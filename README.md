# Project3_European-Airbnb-Data-Visualization
project title: European Airbnb Data Visualization

team members: Matthew Lopez, Steven Carrasquillo, & Mitchell Fairgrieve

project description / outline: For this project we will be analyzing Airbnb data in some of the most popular European cities(Amsterdam, Athens, Barcelona, Berlin, Budapest, Lisbon, London, Paris, Rome, & Vienna). The data includes columns for various attributes such as nightly price, room types, cleanliness ratings and satisfaction ratings, bedrooms, distance from the city center, and more to capture an in-depth understanding of Airbnb prices on weekdays vs weekends in the provided European cities.

Visualizations:
Airbnb locations by country (drop-down)
Plot Airbnb Price vs Distance to City Center/Metro
Plot Airbnb Price vs Cleanliness/Guest Satisfaction
Dataset: Airbnb Prices in European Cities (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/airbnb-prices-in-european-cities/data?select=amsterdam_weekends.csv)

Ethical Considerations: 
The main ethical considerations regarding our project is in terms of the dataset we are using. As we were not the ones who found the data, there is a chance this data was gathered in an unethical manner. While we did our due diligence in vetting our sources, this is a concern we have to watch out for. Another possible ethical concern could be with algorithm bias. This dataset analyzes a lot of airbnbs throughout Europe, however there is a chance that the dataset is excluding certain data points to paint a certain picture. While this was not mentioned anywhere that this was the case, this is something we must keep in mind using 3rd party datasets.
